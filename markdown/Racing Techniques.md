# Racing Technique

This **Racing Technique** section teaches core driving strategies that enhance control, efficiency, and speed on the track. Mastering the use of gears, smooth inputs, cornering, and overtaking builds the foundation of effective racing. Understanding acceleration and braking zones, alongside track positioning and defensive driving, enables drivers to tackle competitive situations with precision and confidence.

## Gearing and Gear Ratio

### Understanding Gear Ratios

Gear ratios represent the balance between engine speed (RPM) and wheel speed, influencing acceleration and top speed:

- **Shorter Gear Ratios**: Increase acceleration but limit top speed, beneficial on twisty tracks where quick response out of corners is key.
  
- **Longer Gear Ratios**: Lower acceleration but allow for higher speeds, ideal for tracks with extended straights where maintaining speed matters most.

For different track layouts, different gear ratios will be more optimal than others. Courses with long straights can better utilize long gearing for higher speed along that straight section, and courses with tighter turns will benefit from shorter gearing to allow for more acceleration out of the turn. A balance can be struck for courses that employ both twisty sections as well as long straights, but too much on one side or the other can lead to detrimental results. 

### Calculating Gear Ratios

Racers can manually calculate or adjust gear ratios to fit specific tracks, often by experimenting with different setups during practice laps. Advanced racing setups involve telemetry data to fine-tune the ratios, ensuring that each gear maximizes the powerband for the track.

### Gear Techniques

- **Rev Matching**: Matching engine RPMs with wheel speed during downshifting reduces shock to the drivetrain, improving car stability. This is especially useful when downshifting into corners.
  
- **Heel-Toe Downshifting**: This advanced technique requires using the heel and toe of the foot to control the brake and throttle simultaneously. It smooths the transition and reduces engine braking effects, stabilizing the car when downshifting into turns.

- **Selecting the Optimal Gear for Corners**: The right gear impacts exit speed. For example, downshifting slightly before the apex enables quicker acceleration upon exiting, maintaining momentum for straightaways.

## Smoothness

### Why Smoothness Matters

Smooth driving not only ensures vehicle stability but also minimizes wear on tires and brakes. It involves using gradual inputs across all controls—steering, throttle, and braking—avoiding jerks or sudden shifts that can unsettle the car. Consistency in smoothness leads to improved control and better lap times.

### Techniques for Smooth Driving

1. **Braking**: Avoid slamming the brakes; instead, apply pressure progressively. A gentle brake entry helps keep the car balanced, with a gradual release as you approach the turn-in point.

2. **Throttle Control**: Smooth throttle application prevents wheel spin and maintains traction. Gradually increase throttle out of a corner to prevent loss of control.

3. **Steering Inputs**: Avoid jerky or rushed steering movements, especially when cornering. Start with subtle inputs and adjust as you go, which maximizes grip and allows for slight corrections as needed.

### Practicing Smoothness

To master smooth driving, practice progressively applying and releasing each control. In simulation settings or on practice tracks, focus on maintaining smooth steering angles, throttle application, and brake pressure, aiming for fluidity in every turn and transition.

## Cornering / Overtaking

### Mastering Cornering

> Most of this is a repeat of the previous lesson, but included here for completeness sake.

Cornering is critical in racing as it involves both speed control and efficient positioning. There are several core techniques:

- **Early Apex**: Suitable for slow, tight turns, taking an early apex provides quicker exit speeds but compromises overall corner speed. It’s effective when setting up for straights following sharp turns.

- **Late Apex**: Ideal for maximizing corner exit speed, especially useful for turns leading into long straights. Late apex cornering allows for better acceleration out of the turn as the car exits closer to the inside line, which can yield a faster exit speed.

- **Geometric Line**: This classic racing line maximizes the corner’s radius, aiming to balance speed and control. It’s often the preferred line on high-speed turns where exit speed is crucial.

### Trail Braking

**Trail Braking** is an advanced cornering technique where the driver maintains slight braking pressure while turning into the corner. This transfers weight to the front tires, increasing front-end grip and enabling a sharper turn. Trail braking requires finesse, as too much brake pressure may lead to oversteer, causing the rear to lose traction, or simply will slow down the car too much, requiring throttle input that could upset weight shift and therefore the balance of the car.

### Overtaking Techniques

1. **Inside Line Overtake**: Approaching from the inside line before the corner provides a strategic advantage. If timed well, it forces the opponent wide, opening a path for a pass.
  
2. **Slipstreaming**: Also called drafting, slipstreaming involves following an opponent closely to reduce aerodynamic drag. This technique is useful on straights, allowing drivers to increase speed and prepare for an overtake just before a corner.

3. **Cut-Back Move**: In this maneuver, allow an opponent to take an inside line on the entry, only to regain position by taking a better line on exit, allowing for a quicker acceleration and potential pass out of the corner.

## Acceleration and Braking Zone

### Braking Zones

Braking zones are track segments where deceleration is necessary to navigate an upcoming turn. Effective braking can define lap times, as it controls entry speed into turns and sets up for optimal cornering. Braking too early causes guaranteed completion of the turn but sacrifices lap time as that extra braking time could have been used to continue at speed before entering the turn. Braking too late can cause you to veer off track and/ or into the barriers and could cause a DNF.

#### Techniques for Braking Zones

- **Threshold Braking**: Brake just short of the tires' maximum grip threshold. This technique allows for the shortest stopping distance, perfect for turns where a quick entry and deceleration are critical. This requires practice and a familiarity with your race car / tire combination. **Locking the brakes/wheels** is a risk, where you apply more brake force than the tires can handle, and causes a situation where the brakes are so strong that the wheels do not turn, but instead your wheels slide across the asphalt as if they were on ice. 

The important thing to note here is that the wheels spinning is what allows for grip and traction when making a turn. Without the wheels turning, you have zero grip in your wheels and you're simply sliding. Progressive or threshold braking allows drivers to manage that threshold before the tires give way to maximize braking ability.

- **Trail Braking**: Lightly maintain braking into the turn to manage weight transfer to the front/turning wheels and maximize front-end grip. This technique allows for sharper cornering but requires precision to avoid oversteer.

### Acceleration Zones

Acceleration zones follow corner exits, where drivers need to quickly regain speed. Finding the right moment to accelerate can make a substantial difference in lap times.

- **Controlled Acceleration**: Gradually increase throttle upon exiting the corner to maintain traction. Abrupt acceleration can cause wheel spin, reducing control and speed.

- **Straight Line Acceleration**: When exiting a corner onto a straight, apply full throttle progressively as soon as the car is stable to gain maximum speed heading into the next section.

## Track Positioning and Defense

### Track Positioning

Track positioning involves selecting lines that maximize speed, efficiency, and positioning relative to competitors. Proper positioning adapts to track conditions, upcoming turns, and strategic objectives.

#### Positioning Techniques

- **Outside-to-Inside Approach**: Begin wide before the turn, move towards the apex, and exit wide. This line maximizes corner radius, which is particularly beneficial for high-speed turns.

- **Setting Up for Sequential Turns**: In sections with consecutive turns, setting up the car for the next corner rather than focusing solely on the current one can yield better overall speed and balance.

- **Corner Exit Focus**: In turns that lead onto straights, prioritize a fast exit by positioning the car for a smooth and early throttle application. This approach sacrifices entry speed for a faster straight-line exit.

### Defensive Driving

Defensive driving techniques help maintain position, especially in close racing scenarios. Key defensive strategies include:

1. **Blocking the Inside Line**: Taking the inside line forces opponents to take an outside line, making overtaking more challenging, especially in tight corners.

2. **Early Corner Entry**: Initiating turns earlier than usual can prevent opponents from attempting an inside overtake, keeping the driver’s line more predictable and limiting space.

3. **Avoiding Excessive Blocking**: While blocking is permitted, overly aggressive moves can result in penalties. Maintain fair, predictable lines to retain position without risking infractions.

### Defensive Techniques Against Overtaking
- **Line Blocking**: Blocking the ideal racing line with the body of your car is the best way to maintain a defensive state. With your car body blocking the ideal line, the attacking car now has to drive a sub-optimal racing line to try to overtake or get around you. 
- **Mirror Checking**: Regularly monitor mirrors to anticipate opponents’ moves, especially during braking zones and straight sections.
  
- **Braking Consistency**: Predictable, steady braking is harder for opponents to exploit. Avoid sudden or erratic braking patterns that could open gaps.

A practical section has been developed in order to practice defensive racing maneuvers.
